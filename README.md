📄 Live Guide: [https://lone-star-xr-lab.github.io/headset-overview/](https://lone-star-xr-lab.github.io/headset-overview/)

This repo contains a **quick reference guide** for the Meta Quest 3 headset.  
It’s designed as a **printable handout (or PDF)** to help new users learn the essential headset controls in the correct order:

1. **Head Strap Fit** – how to put on and adjust the headset  
2. **Power** – turning on, sleep/wake, and shutdown  
3. **Lens (IPD) Adjustment** – setting lens spacing for clarity  
4. **Volume** – adjusting audio levels

## 📸 Image Sources
The headset images were generated from the **official Meta Quest 3 `.glb` 3D models** (downloaded from the Meta Store).  

### Workflow:
1. Download the official **GLB model** from the Meta Store.  
2. Load the model using [modelviewer.dev](https://modelviewer.dev/) (`<model-viewer>`).  
3. Rotate and zoom the model to the desired angle.  
4. Take high-resolution screenshots directly from the browser.  
5. Save and optimize as `.webp` or `.jpg` inside the `/images` folder.  

✅ This approach is fast, accurate, and doesn’t require Blender.  
✅ Ensures the reference points are true to the actual headset hardware.
